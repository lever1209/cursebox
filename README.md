# cursebox
it overhauls how light works in minecraft

## compatibility
im too lazy to test it all and shit, so, if it works it works, if not, rip
eventually i will rewrite for compatibility, but as it stands, this mod is meant to be used alone
partly because of all of the engine changes such as light levels and their behavior (its normally 0 - 15, but will be 0 - 31)
